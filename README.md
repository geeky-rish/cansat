# CANSAT Data Visualization

Welcome to the CANSAT Data Visualization project! This repository contains Python code for visualizing telemetry data collected from a CANSAT (Can-Sized Satellite) project. The project leverages various sensors to collect data and uses Python libraries to create insightful visualizations.

## Project Overview

The CANSAT project involves collecting data from multiple sensors and visualizing this data to gain insights into the performance and behavior of the satellite. This repository provides Python scripts for processing and visualizing telemetry data from sensors such as DHT11, MPU6050, GPS, and more.

## Features

- **Real-time Data Visualization:** Visualize temperature, humidity, acceleration, and GPS coordinates.
- **Interactive Graphs:** Use Plotly and Matplotlib for interactive and static graphs.
- **Data Processing:** Clean and preprocess data for accurate visualizations.
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Gain insights into sensor data trends and patterns.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python libraries (listed below)

### Usage

**Data Collection:**
   Ensure you have the telemetry data files in the appropriate format. Place them in the `data/` directory.
